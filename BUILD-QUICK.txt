BUILDING ELECTRON DESKTOP APP
==========================================

QUICK START:

1. Install dependencies (including Electron):
   npm install

2. Build desktop app for all platforms:
   npm run build

3. Find installers in dist/ folder:
   - Windows: Installer + Portable .exe (~100MB)
   - macOS: .dmg installer (~90MB)
   - Linux: AppImage, .deb, .rpm (~100MB)

PLATFORM-SPECIFIC BUILDS:

   npm run build:windows  (Windows installers)
   npm run build:macos    (macOS .dmg - requires macOS)
   npm run build:linux    (Linux packages)

TEST BEFORE BUILDING:

   npm start              (Opens desktop app window)

WHAT YOU GET:

- Native desktop application
- Own window (no browser needed)
- Start Menu / Applications folder integration
- Professional installers
- Auto-updates (if configured)

FILE SIZES:

Apps are ~100MB because they include:
- Chromium browser engine
- Node.js runtime
- Your application code
This is normal for Electron apps.

DISTRIBUTION:

Windows:
  - Share the installer .exe
  - Users run it and follow wizard
  - App appears in Start Menu

macOS:
  - Share the .dmg file
  - Users drag to Applications
  - May need to allow in Security settings

Linux:
  - AppImage: Make executable and run
  - DEB: sudo dpkg -i file.deb
  - RPM: sudo rpm -i file.rpm
